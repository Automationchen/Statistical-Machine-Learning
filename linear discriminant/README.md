use the dataset ldaData.txt, containing 137 feature points x. 
The first 50 points belong to class C1, the second 43 to class C2, the last 44 to class C3.

Use Linear Discriminant Analysis to classify the points in the dataset, i.e., assume Gaussian distributions in each class with equal covariances and use the posterior distributions for assigning classes.

there are two plots with the data points using a different color for each class: 
  one plot with the original dataset
  one with the samples classified according to  LDA classifier.
