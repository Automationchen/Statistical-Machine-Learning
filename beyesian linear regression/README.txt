dataset linRegData.txt, containing 150 points in the format <input variable,output variable>. 

The input is generated by a sinusoid function, while the output is the joint trajectory of a compliant robotic arm. The first 20 data points are the training set and the remainder are the testing set.

Using Bayesian linear regression, plot the mean and the standard deviation of the predictive distribution learned using the first f10, 12, 16, 20, 50, 150g data points (one plot per case; plot it in the interval x 2 [0, 2]).
