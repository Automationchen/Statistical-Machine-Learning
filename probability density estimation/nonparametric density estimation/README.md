the datasets nonParamTrain.txt for training and nonParamTest.txt for evaluating the performance of  model.

1.histogram: Compute and plot the histograms using 0.02, 0.5, 2.0 size bins of the training data.
2.Kernel Density Estimate:Compute the probability density estimate using a Gaussian kernel with sigma= 0.03, 0.2 and 0.8 of the training data.
3.K-Nearest Neighbors: Estimate the probability density with the K-nearest neighbors method with K = 2, K = 8, K = 35.
