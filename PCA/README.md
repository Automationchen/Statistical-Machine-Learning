The dataset iris.txt contains data from three kind of Iris flowers (‘Setosa’, ‘Versicolour’ and ‘Virginica’) with 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Each row contains a sample while the last attribute is the label (0 means that the sample comes from a ‘Setosa’ plant, 1 from a ‘Versicolour’ and 2 from ‘Virginica’).

Apply PCA on a normalized dataset and generate a plot showing the proportion (percentage) of the cumulative variance explained.
